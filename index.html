  This Application is developed in-order to re-nurture the young minds staying at home during this pandemic by making them learn various subjects at their pace and homely environment through the means of provoking Visuals and Charts. Why to develop an app when we have online class scheme should be a doubt to the parents ? Its because using online mode of education we cant tangle the children by force to sit and accomplish their missions on dual sub-judice of time ,and moreover as we every flower doesn't bloom in front of the physical representees, similarly not all children share their their provoking thoughts at the same time to the teachers,it takes time and Online classes are time bound so we cant pressurize our kids for that time specificity to be ideally talent , which is illogical.</p>
